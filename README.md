# Pallaanguli
Code for the Tamilnadu (India) traditional game Pallaanguli...
It spelled in Tamil as பல்லாங்குழி, in English it spelled sometimes as Pallanguli / Pallanguzhi.
There are many variations to this game in all over south India.
However the following rules and set-ups are considered for this version of the game.
SET-UP:
1. It should be played by exactly 2 players.
2. There are 14 holes in total and 7 for each player.
3. Each player has 35 'CHOLIS' (Tamil spelling சோளி). But I called them as coins in the code and here onwards.
4. Each hole should be filled initially with 5 coins.

RULES:
1. The player who starts the game, usually is chosen by tossing or similar. This is not implemented in this version. Whoever plays first is called Player 1.
2. PLAYER TURN:
  1. A player can choose any hole from his holes.
  2. He takes all the coins im the chosen hole.
  3. Those coins will be distributed next holes by single coin until the coins remain.
  4. And if the next hole has coins, then he will remove the coins & distributes as above to next holes.
  5. But if the next hole is empty where he needs to take, then the turn ends. And he can take out the next hole to the empty one.
